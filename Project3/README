To Run Daemon:

Make sure everything in Project3/Daemon_lib/ is in wherever you're system lib is. You can specify it via the jvm args as below as well.

java -Djava.library.path=/c/projects/java/B490PageRank/Project3/Daemon_win_lib -jar Daemon.jar

Note: If you're running on *nix, make sure you swap in the appropriate activemq jar into Daemon_lib. Also use Daemon_linux.jar instead.
