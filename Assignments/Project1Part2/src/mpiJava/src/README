For historical reasons, subdirectory `C/' contains native method source
files from previous `mpiJava' releases, while subdirectory `native/'
contains C source files specific to `mpjdev'.

For similarly unsystematic reasons, the Java sources for the package
`mpi' are under `Java/mpi/', whereas the Java sources for the package
`mpjdev' are directly under `./mpjdev/'.

The build process is likely more fragile than it ought to be: must
build in this order

  Java/
  mpjdev/
  native/
  C/

There are a couple of odd dependencies, largely on account of trying
to minimize changes to previously existing (and well-tested) mpiJava
1.2.5 directories.
