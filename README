!!HEY YOU, READ ME!!
Structure:
repo->[assignments]->[assignment#] -> src, docs, resources (assigment specific files)

src: is where we should do all of our work and place any dependencies, modules, additions, etc..
resources: ALL resources for that specific assigment portion
docs: self explanatory

PLEASE try to avoid committing .class files (unless they are a provided resource)
as well as your .classpath (since we will likely all have different working environments)

If someone wants to changes this, please let's discuss it first, re-organizing things locally after every pull isn't much fun ;)
