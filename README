!!HEY YOU, READ ME!!
Structure:
repo->[Assignments]->[assignment#] -> project, materials (assignment provided), doc
[project]-> bin, src, resources (project/build specific), lib

src: where we should do all of our work and place any modules, additions, etc..
resources: resources (input files, data, etc..) for that specific project
bin: build dir, shouldn't need to do anything here
lib: to place dependencies that we have not written/modified

PLEASE try to avoid committing .class files (unless they are a provided resource)
as well as your .classpath (since we will likely all have different working environments)

If someone wants to changes this, please let's discuss it first, re-organizing things locally after every pull isn't much fun ;)
